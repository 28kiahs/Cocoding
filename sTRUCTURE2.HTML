		<div id="flex-item1" style="border: 15 px solid magenta; padding: 5px;">Why I Like It:<br><p>
			Descendants shows that people who really want to change and become good can do so. It uses a great plot, great costumes, great scenery and great acting to convey that message. It also shows how a caring environment can get people to change.<br>The music is fantastic. Broadway legend Kristin Chenoweth plays Disney villain Maleficent, which she has described as her darkest role yet. Her song, "Evil Like Me," has been stuck in my head for a week. The songs have fantastic choreography.<br>The costumes are edgy. Project Runway's Kara Saun designed the costumes, and we loved them. Favorite outfit: Mal's sparkly purple coronation ballgown.<br>It has positive messages.  The kids of the Disney Villains go to school with the kids of the Disney heroes. The villains want to get the Fairy Godmother's wand so their parents can take over the world. But let's just say that they choose a smarter path. You can use it as a jumping off point about why you don't have to fit in with the crowd.
